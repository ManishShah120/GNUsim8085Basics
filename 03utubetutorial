;Second Tutorial : Topic - Basic operations with registers
;We are storing the data into the D register
;MVI D,05H
;We are moving data from one register to another
;i.e., we are moving value of D to B
;MOV B,D
;Halting our program
;HLT


;Second Program Adding two numbers
;MVI A,05H
;MVI B,06H
;ADD B
;WHATEVER THE VALUE OF Accumulator WILL BE THE result will be stored at the
;default accumulator(A)
;HLT



;Third Program Subtracting two numbers
;MVI A,07H
;MVI B,02H
;SUB B
;Whatever is the content of B will be subracted from the accumulator and the result will
;will be stored in the accumulater
;HLT


;Fourth program
MVI A,07H
SUI 05H
; Sui will store the imediate value of the result in the accumulator
;Subtract immediate from the accumulator
HLT

;;Also we can use ADI instead of ADD
